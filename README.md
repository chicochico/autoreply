Inspired by Alex Chesser's [medium article](https://index.medium.com/career-advice-nobody-gave-me-never-ignore-a-recruiter-4474eac9556).

### First Call

> Hello,
>
> Thanks for reaching out. I'm always interested and open for new exciting opportunities. However I'm unable to actively respond and hop on a call with every request I receive, as many represent a very poor fit. I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do I'd like to learn more about the oportunity.
>
> Could you provide more information about the company, the job description and compensation details for the role?
>
> In the absence of detailed information about the oportunity I'll be unavailable for further questions. Thanks again for reaching out.
>
> Looking forward to hearing from you.\
> Francisco
